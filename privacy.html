                        <h5>5. <b>Data Sharing</b></h5>
                        <p>5.1 We share our data with various third parties for numerous reasons in order that day to day activities are carried out in accordance with our relevant policies and procedures. In order that we can monitor compliance by these
                            third parties with data protection laws, we will require the third-party organisations to enter in to an agreement with us to govern the processing of data, security measures to be implemented and responsibility for breaches.</p>
                        <p>Personal data is from time to time shared amongst us and third parties who require to process personal data that we process as well. Both us and the third party will be processing that data in their individual capacities as data
                            controllers. 5.2.2 Where we share in the processing of personal data with a third-party organisation (e.g. for processing of the employees’ pension), we shall require the third-party organisation to enter in to a data sharing
                            agreement with us in accordance with the terms of the model data sharing agreement set out in Appendix 3 to this policy where the circumstances of the data sharing require such an agreement to be in place.
                        </p>
                        <p><b>Data Processors</b></p>
                        <p>A data processor is a third-party entity that processes personal data on behalf of us and are frequently engaged if certain parts of our work is outsourced (e.g. payroll, maintenance and repair works).</p>
                        <p>5.3.1 A data processor must comply with data protection laws. Our data processors must ensure they have appropriate technical security measures in place, maintain records of processing activities and notify us if a data breach
                            is suffered. <br>5.3.2 If a data processor wishes to sub-contact their processing, our prior written consent must be obtained. Upon a sub-contracting of processing, the data processor will be liable in full for the data protection
                            breaches of their sub-contractors.<br> 5.3.3 Where we contract with a third party to process personal data held by us, it shall require the third party to enter in to a data processing agreement with us in accordance with the
                            terms of the model data processing agreement set out in Appendix 4 to this policy.
                        </p>


                        <h5>6. <b>Data Storage and Security</b></h5>
                        <p>All personal data held by us must be stored securely, whether electronically or in paper format.</p>

                        <p><b>Paper Storage:</b> If personal data is stored on paper it should be kept in a secure place where unauthorised personnel cannot access it. Employees should make sure that no personal data is left where unauthorised personnel
                            can access it. When the personal data is no longer required it must be disposed of by the employee so as to ensure its destruction. If the personal data requires to be retained on a physical file then the employee should ensure
                            that it is properly secured within the file (e.g. stapled, or the documents are put on a Treasury Tag within the file) which is then stored in accordance with our storage provisions.</p>

                        <p><b>Electronic Storage:</b> Personal data stored electronically must also be protected from unauthorised use and access. Personal data should be password protected when being sent internally or externally to our data processors
                            or those with whom we have entered in to a data sharing agreement. If personal data is stored on removable media (CD, DVD, USB memory stick) then that removable media must be stored securely at all times when not being used
                            and information encrypted on that media device. Personal data should not be saved directly to mobile devices and should be stored on designated drivers and servers.</p>
                        <p><b>7. Breaches</b>A data breach can occur at any point when handling personal data and we have reporting duties in the event of a data breach or potential breach occurring. Breaches which pose a risk to the rights and freedoms
                            of the data subjects who are the subject of the breach require to be reported externally in accordance with clause 7.3 hereof.</p>
                        <p><b>Internal Reporting</b>We take the security of data very seriously and in the unlikely event of a breach will take the following steps:<br> ● As soon as the breach or potential breach has occurred, and in any event no later than
                            six (6) hours after it has occurred, the data protection officer (DPO) must be notified in writing of (i) the breach; (ii) how it occurred; and (iii) what the likely impact of that breach is on any data subject(s); <br>● we
                            must seek to contain the breach by whatever means available;<br> ● the DPO must consider whether the breach is one which requires to be reported to the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) and data subjects affected and
                            do so in accordance with this clause 7;<br> ● notify third parties in accordance with the terms of any applicable data sharing agreements
                        </p>
                        <p><b>Reporting to the ICO</b>The DPO is required to report any breaches which pose a risk to the rights and freedoms of the data subjects who are the subject of the breach to the ICO within 72 hours of the breach occurring. The DPO
                            must also consider whether it is appropriate to notify those data subjects affected by the breach.</p>
